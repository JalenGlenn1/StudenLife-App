# What is Student Life?
- Student Life is an app designed for grade school students to help them with various math subjects by giving them quizzes for extra practice.
- A user can also review past quizzes taken, to see their score and the correct answer to each problem.

# Tech Stack
- Android Studio (using Kotlin): Environment and language used to develop our application.
- Firebase: Used to set up user authentication for our application.

# Architectural Style
- implements the Model-View-Controller architecture.
- The View represents the user interface within the app. The View is manipulated by the Controller as it executes appropriate action to each event and updates the View.
- The reaction is a call to a method on the Model, and then the controller updates the model. The Model is the data stored within the application i.e., each quiz.
